AI-powered n8n workflow for automated marketing campaign budget allocation and ROI optimization.
# üß† n8n-Campaign-Allocator

AI-powered **n8n workflow** for automated marketing campaign **budget allocation and ROI optimization**.

---

## üöÄ Overview
This project uses **n8n** automation to read campaign performance data from a CSV file, analyze historical ROI by channel, and automatically recommend optimized budget allocations to maximize conversions within given constraints.  

The workflow integrates:
- CSV Upload and Parsing  
- Budget Parameter Setup  
- ROI and Conversion Optimization Logic  
- Google Sheets Output for Recommendations  

---

## üìÇ Input Data (CSV Format)
Upload your campaign data via the webhook node using a CSV file with columns like:

| channel | historical_spend | conversions | roi | min_budget | max_budget |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Google   | 10000            | 50           | 2.5 | 5000        | 15000       |
| Meta     | 5000             | 20           | 1.8 | 2000        | 7000        |
| LinkedIn | 3000             | 10           | 1.2 | 1000        | 5000        |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **CSV Upload:** User uploads campaign performance data through an n8n webhook.  
2. **Parse CSV:** The workflow reads and validates the data.  
3. **Budget Parameters:** Total budget and constraints are read from workflow inputs.  
4. **Optimization Engine:** Calculates optimal allocations per channel to maximize ROI or conversions.  
5. **Google Sheet Output:** Writes recommended allocations, expected conversions, and ROI scores to a connected Google Sheet.

## üßÆ Output (Google Sheet)
| channel | recommended_budget | expected_conversions | expected_roi | notes |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| Google   | 12000              | 65                   | 2.8           | Max ROI channel |
| Meta     | 6000               | 28                   | 2.0           | Increased spend |
| LinkedIn | 3000               | 12                   | 1.3           | Within cap |
